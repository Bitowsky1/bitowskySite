        <p>Heya! I'm Bitowsky!</p>
        <p>I'm a Polish, 20 years old, self-taught <span class="introTalk" style="color:lightgreen">Game Developer</span>, <span class="introTalk" style="color:lightcoral">2D Animator</span>, <span class="introTalk" style="color:lightblue">Music Composer</span> and <span class="introTalk" style="color:lightgoldenrodyellow">more</span>!

        <!--<p>I have been on the internet since 2016. And since then, I have changed my nickname, avatar, and overall what I do on the internet.</p>
        <p style="color:lightgreen">I do not play much games, but the ones I really love are the odd and weird ones! Games, like "World Of Goo" or "There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension". Those inspire me, as a Game Developer, to create my own odd and weird games. Will I ever succeed with releasing some big one? Only time will tell!</p>

        <p>I have been passionate about creating games ever since I had access to PC. When I was starting my adventure with creating games, I used some of the basic engines, such as Scratch and Kodu. In 2018, I switched to using Construct 2, which I fell in love with.</p>
        <p>At the beginning, I have never published any of my works to the outside, until December 2020. During that time, I have published my first "bigger" game called "Where Is My Pointer", which was a local multiplayer game about finding the position of your mouse. While it didn't revolutionized the game industry at all, I felt more confident, when it comes to showcasing my stuff. It is also around that time, where I created Bit Studio - my own team of passionate game creators. But at that time, it was a one-person brigade.</p>
