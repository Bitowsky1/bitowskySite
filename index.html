    <hr>

    <p>Could it be because the site is currently unavaiable to see to the public and not because it was very buggy and not very optimized in terms of back-end and front-end?<br><br><br><br>Who knows!</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>But while you are contemplating, you can visit all of my other social medias! (Or at least the one that you tolerate or something)<br><br>Once the website is back up and running, I will definitely let you know through one of those platforms!</p>
