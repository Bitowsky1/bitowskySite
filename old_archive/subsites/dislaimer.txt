Dislaimer regarding using my work/animated pins:

- I do not reserve any strict right for them, so feel free to use it in your videos, posts etc. without asking for permission first

- I'm open for any kind of collaboration that includes making animated pins!

- If you want, I can also make any animated pin for you as a paid commission! Art trade is also possible, but only, if I'm gonna be ok with that.

Thanks for supporting my work!
