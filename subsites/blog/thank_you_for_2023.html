        <br>
        <p class="textFont centerText" style="text-align: center;">What a crazy year, right? For some people, this year was getting very long. For some - it wooshed pretty quickly. For me, though? It was just perfect! Especially because of the new skills I have gained throughout this year. I learned a lot about programming, music creation and 2D animation as well! I also took more focus for vector art, whether it’s Brawl Stars related or anything besides that. It was a year, when I could discover my true skills. And I’m very excited to discover even more of them!
            <br><br>
            But, I would lie if I said that I achieved that alone. I would be more than wrong! There were a lot of people that I had the pleasure to meet this year. Some of them have been with me for even longer! They have shown their own amazing talents that I could watch infinitely or that I could just hang out casually. The person that I am, wouldn’t be the same without you all, who has been supporting my work all of the time! I’m very grateful for that!
            <br><br>
            That’s why I have prepared this blog to point out some of the most supportive people that I had the pleasure to meet with this year (or I knew longer). While I got a lot of support, those people were a rain of kind words and overall just cool people I could hang out with. Without them, I don’t know where I would be right now!
        </p>
        
        <h1 class="sect1">So big thank you to:</h1>

            <p class="textFont charText" style="color: white;">If there is a person who is a definition of constant support and trustworthy friend, VJ would definitely be called like that. The neverending kind words you told me were very wholesome and I appreciate each of them. You’ve been one of my best friends I could ever ask for.
                <br><br>And also, how could I not mention your amazing and extraordinary skills you have, when it comes to pixel art. Man… every piece of art, even if it’s just a Work In Progress, it’s just a masterpiece. Whenever I scroll past Twitter and I see a new post that has your artwork, I just look at it and then… “wow, this is so cool”. The vibe you put into those pixel arts is just eye-candy for someone like me. Thanks to that, I’m able to shape my own vision for the projects I’m working on.
                <br><br>So, I hope that whether you feel happy or when you’re in a very bad situation, you must remember that there is always somebody who will support you, no matter what. Keep it going dude, you’ve got it!

                <br><br>
                Not only are you passionate when it comes to making personal music, but you’ve also shown a big support for my projects as well! I do not regret any music you made for me. Because I hear that you improve every time I listen to your new music.
                <br><br>
                And also, I had a lot of fun talking with you - especially when we were trolling each other. It always puts a smile on my face, whenever I reread the stuff that we were talking about. I do not regret any time spent on talking with you!

                <br><br>
                Hypo is a very skillful artist - whether it’s digital or pixel art (man of multiple talents). When it came to digital one, I just fell in love with their work, and I wanted to vectorize them. And so I did! So thank you Hypo for supporting all of my vectorized fanarts of your characters. It really boosted my confidence a lot!
                <br><br>
                Also another thing I’m thankful to you is showing me the music you like! At the beginning of 2023, you were listening to a lot of Japanese city pop. You showed me that and…now it’s basically my time machine to Winter of 2023. Whenever I listen to it nowadays, I just remember about the great memories we made together back then. I’m not saying that nowadays we don’t interact at all. Just the opposite!
                <br><br>
                I had and still have a lot of fun talking with you. Do not worry about any burnouts, because I know that whenever you do art, it’s always gonna be awesome, no matter what!

            <p class="textFont charText" style="color: white;">First of all, thank you very much for contributing to translating my Fangame. We would probably never meet, if you never messaged me, haha!
                <br><br>
                With that said, Ibrahim is a very talented game developer, who gained a little bit of success thanks to his popular horror games. I, personally, never play any horror games (reason should be obvious), but I decided to actually try out some of his games. And I gotta say, when I finally got back home from hospital after getting a heart attack from his games (joke), I realized that they are actually very well made for a one-person team.
                <br><br>
                As a person with similar interests as me, I got along with Ibrahim very easily. I really enjoyed our talks about game development, the cool solutions to some problems and overall, whenever there was an occasion.

            <p class="textFont charText" style="color: white;">When I first met Deco, we weren’t talking too much, besides when it was about Molyan Stars. But during the summer of this year, we actually had the opportunity to talk more, because we were participating in a game jam hosted by Game Maker Toolkit. And it worked out very well!
                <br><br>
                Deco has a talent for taking care of projects he’s in. He was very helpful, when it came to making decisions and even art! He has a very creative artstyle I have never seen before. I’m so happy that he is a part of my Game Development studio!
                <br><br>
                It’s a pleasure that I had an opportunity to meet such an organized and skillful person. I’m sure that whatever we will make together, it will be awesome!

                <br><br>
                Even though you put away a little game development, I still think it’s worth mentioning that you also were very passionate about your own projects. And I’m very happy that I could help with it in some way or another.
                <br><br>
                I cannot believe that I wouldn’t meet such a funny person, if I wasn’t doing free music commissioning. Thanks man, for believing in my skill back then!

            <p class="textFont charText" style="color: white;">If you know me mostly from animating Brawl Stars fanmade pins, then you should know that Nitay and the next person are the guys who were responsible for my boost in popularity. How?
                <br><br>
                Starting from Nitay - he made an awesome concept brawler for Bruno. When I saw that post in January, I had an urge to animate the pin for this character, which was odd, because back then, the only pins I animated were for my close, non brawl stars friends in Summer of 2022.
                <br><br>
                Because of that unexpected success, I would like to say a big “Thank You” to Nitay! I don’t know where I would be right now, if it wasn’t for your awesome character concept!
                <br><br>
                And nowadays, the amazingness of your art hasn't changed at all! You still show your amazing skills when it comes to different skins or characters. I really wish for you that you will fight through your tough times. Because I honestly don’t know what I would do, if you just disappeared. (Also thank you for your constant support in comments!)</p>

            <p class="textFont charText" style="color: black;">As said before, Marley is also the person responsible for helping me get an audience for my animated pins. He was the one who designed the pins for Nitay’s character. Thanks to their amazing pin designs, I was able to gain a lot of love from a lot of people. Thank you for the support back then!
            <br><br>
            Nowadays, I enjoy whenever you make a custom pin for various characters. It’s cool to see your work now and then. I see that you put a lot of passion into your work. And that’s what’s important for any good artist.

                <br><br>
                I assume that you probably heard that like a thousand times from everyone, but I think no one will be hurt from saying it again. You are one of the biggest inspirations for most pin designers in the Brawl Stars Community! Your work is a big base for inspiring vector artists, who have a lot of fun doing what you’re doing! I would be one of them, if not the fact, that I’m not a perfect pin designer. But when it comes to animating some of your pins, I just feel relieved, so thank you!
                <br><br>
                Aside from the pins, I had a lot of fun talking with you, even if we rarely had time to actually do that. And I'm even happy that we were able to play some matches together! I really hope we can talk and play more in the future, haha!
                <br><br>
                Wishing you even more success as official pin designer! You are awesome!

                Either way, thanks to both of them, I was able to enter the Molyan Stars team in February, which at that time was one of the most inspiring projects I’ve ever been in. And I was still a beginner back then! So it was very risky, but in the end, it came out very good! Thank you both!
                <br><br>
                Actually, I also have some individual bonus thanks to both of you.
                <br><br>
                Molyan - thanks for being an understandable, trustworthy and overall organized lead that was always willing to listen to our feedback. I can always count on you!
                <br><br>
                And Davi - thanks for your support when it came to my work and projects. You really thought I will not mention the 3D renders you made for my game? You’re wrong, then!

                <br><br>
                Whenever you make a new pin, it’s always a high quality piece of art that a lot of people love! Probably because you put a lot of effort into what you’re doing. And as I said before, it’s very important for a successful artist. And I enjoy what you’ve been doing this year.
                <br><br>
