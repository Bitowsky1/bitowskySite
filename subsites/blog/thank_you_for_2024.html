            Ah, so it's that time of the year again, huh? Where did all of those 366 days go?
            <br><br>
Maybe left somewhere in the corners of Starr Park? Maybe travelling on an excessive Atomic Express and exploring the mystery of distant signal? Maybe pressing that annoying button that sends other to debt?
<br><br>
For me, this year was, once again, a big challenge. Maybe even bigger than the last year! With lots of final exams, game development stuff, animation, translation, etc. I definitely wasn't bored, haha!
<br><br>
Successes happen and failures exist. Everyone had its ups and downs. Maybe even its lefts and rights? Maybe even corners? The metrics are the only limitation!
<br><br>
But of course, this year wouldn't be as amazing as if I was alone. I had tons of support and tons of kind words said to me. So it's my duty to now thank some of the most important people that I had pleasure interacting with this year!

                Everyone has their own inspiration! When it comes to pin animating - mine are people from this company!
                <br><br>Thank you guys for always providing the highest quality of the animations for the pins! I'm always amazed with each update about how beautiful all of this looks like!
                <br><br>And not only the pins! From the VFX to UI/UX animations (that are not pins) also looks amazing, thanks to your additional work!
                <br><br>And a special shout-out to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jaehoon.jung.9/" style="color: rgb(93, 53, 84);">Jaehoon Jung</a> (who is one of the people from the company) for being a kind person and who always supported my work! It means a lot for me, so thank you very much!
                <br><br>I'm glad that you can be my inspiration, haha!
                <br><br>I can't wait to see, how the animations will improve in the 2025!
                <br><br>Wishing all of you lots of successes and more amazing pin animations!

            What will 2025 bring upon us? How our lives will evolve through this new adventure? Even the best of the Fortune Tellers won't be able to predict!
            <br><br>But one is sure - this year will definitely be an improvement over the 2024...to some extend.
            <br><br>I'm not sure whether I'm ready to leave this cozy 2024...
            <br><br>But, the time.
            <br><br>You cannot stop time.
            <br><br>It can only face onwards.
            <br><br>And never backwards.
            <br><br>And it will make sure, that noone is left behind...
            <br><br>
