                <p class="projectComment">I was one of the many huge fans of the original "World of Goo" (and overall Tomorrow Corporation games) but we already accepted the fact, that the sequel would not happen after 15 years. Well, now imagine my reaction of me waking up to a notification that a trailer for World of Goo 2 has been published. That was a wild day, haha!<br><br>
                When they said, that they were looking for translators, I didn't hesitated and immidietally emailed them with my interest in helping with it.<br><br>
                We've all been directed by Ron Carmel himself about the guidelines and rules. He was always ready to answer our questions, so this process went smooth as butter. Thanks Ron!<br><br>  
                I was working on Polish Translation with 3 other people, that were kind and always ready to point out my mistakes. I still cringe to this day, thinking about my dumbest typos and spelling errors!
                <br><br>This is by far the biggest project that I helped with translation. It was such an unforgettable experience! Thank you 2D BOY and Tomorrow Corporation for this opportunity! And for the sequel!

                <p class="projectComment">As I'm also a fan of "There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension", this game has brought my attention as it also had the same vibe as TING:WD. And so, I played through the demo and I loved it! I joined the DNBTG (Do Not Buy This Game) community in late 2023 and I'm still part of it.<br><br>
                In the late 2024, I toyed around with Unity Asset Extractor and I was snooping around the files of DNBTG and I found the text files and textures for different langauges. And so, I have made some unofficial translation and texture localization, after which I shared some progress on the DNBTG server. Developer saw my work and proposed me that I can do the rest of the translation and he can publish it globally. I was more than grateful for him giving me the opportunity, so I accepted it and got to work!<br><br>
                Well, not entirely "me" but "we", as I got a massive help from Marcin Pilarski and Jod Emperor Kaczy≈Ñski. I had a great time chatting with them and the process of translation went really well, thanks to their help and constant pointing out my stupidest mistakes, haha!<br><br>
                This might be a smaller project, where I contributed with my translation, but it was still a blast! Wishing lots of luck to the Developer with releasing the full version somewhere in the future!

                <p class="projectComment">This is a bit of an obscure fact, when it comes to games, where I proposed my help. Even I sometimes forget, that I contributed to this game, haha!<br><br>
                I'm not entirely sure, if I remember this correctly, but I stumbled upon Pulsus in 2021 - when I was super fixated with the game "osu" (No, I don't play it anymore lol). Pulsus has a similar game layout, so I was interested in it. And boy, was I very bad at this game, haha!<br><br>
                The process of me getting into the translation team is now as visible as me, waving towards you in thick fog - I do not remember all of it! But I know, that I have contacted with the Developer of the game and they were very nice and they accepted me. And this marked my first ever "global translation" that I have been part of.<br><br>
                I didn't translate the entire game, as there were also some people who already did some good chunk of it, but I was able to scan through a lot of texts to verify the already translated one, or to translate the ones that were yet not touched.<br><br>
                I think the game was fully translated to Polish in 2022, but the translation were finally published...with quite of a delay. To be exact, they (Polish as well as other languages) went global in early 2024. So around 2 years of waiting. Of course, I'm not saying that I'm mad or something. I just find it a bit funny, that between the start of translation process and its release, I have evolved a lot, when it comes to what I do and what I like.<br><br>
                Remember! You always have to start from SOMEWHERE!
