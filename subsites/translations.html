                <p class="projectComment">I was one of the many huge fans of the original "World of Goo" (and overall Tomorrow Corporation games) but we already accepted the fact, that the sequel would not happen after 15 years. Well, now imagine my reaction of me waking up to a notification that a trailer for World of Goo 2 has been published. That was a wild day, haha!<br><br>
                When they said, that they were looking for translators, I didn't hesitated and immidietally emailed them with my interest in helping with it.<br><br>
                We've all been directed by Ron Carmel himself about the guidelines and rules. He was always ready to answer our questions, so this process went smooth as butter. Thanks Ron!<br><br>  
                I was working on Polish Translation with 3 other people, that were kind and always ready to point out my mistakes. I still cringe to this day, thinking about my dumbest typos and spelling errors!
                <br><br>This is by far the biggest project that I helped with translation. It was such an unforgettable experience! Thank you 2D BOY and Tomorrow Corporation for this opportunity! And for the sequel!
