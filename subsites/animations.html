        <h1>UI / UX AND 2D ANIMATION</h1>

        <p>I am a passionate UI/UX designer and animator.</p>
        <p>I really love making all sorts of foreground work. I've been using this passion to unofficially animate some of the Brawl Stars related pins (emotes). Also, I'm able to handle UI/UX part of work in my own Game Development.</p>
        <p>For design I use <span style="color:lightblue">Inkscape</span> and for Animation I use <span style="color:#9696FC; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #00005B;">Adobe Animate</span>.</p>

        <h1>A BIT OF HISTORY...</h1>

        <p>I have been a fan of UI/UX, ever since I was little. Various game elements or even the graphic design in some TV shows made me even more fascinated in the User Experience world!</p>
        <p>I have transformed this passion into reality - most noticably with Brawl Stars Animated Pins (Emotes). I had a passion for animating them since 2021, but never really put a lot of effort into it. But in 2022, I had an opportunity to learn how Adobe Animate works a little. And with this, I created my first batch of animated pins! Which looked...</p>

        <p>...yea. I still had a long journey in front of me, haha!</p>
        <p>For the rest of 2022, I have been making some private animated pins for my friends.</p>
        <p>In 2023, everything changed when I first published an animated pin, that has been designed by someone else. From that point on, I have been warmly accepted into Brawl Stars community as a pin animator! Even though I'm one of the only pin animators, who do this kind of thing as their main content, people still enjoyed my works! And this kept me motivated to animate the pins. <3</p>
        <p>Overtime, my style of animation has been changing. I started by exporting elements from Inkscape to Adobe Animate, then (still in 2023) I was animating with some in-app Adobe Animate tools. And the finally, in 2024 I changed my method once again - using Supercell limitations, such as the use of simple shapes. This is the style that I work with to this day, and I find it very interesting! Such way of optimization is just amazing!</p>
